    "\n",
    "In clues.json, every line is a separate game, and the values are stored in lists. This is an advisable way to store the data, but it was the only way I could find to scrape all the clues and their correct responses in one spider. We make this data readable by pandas by converting all the lists to have equal length and then reading every game in separately, and concatenating all games together. In the raw data, the 'game_id' column is a list of length one, so we multiply that by the number of clues in the game. There is also the possibility that there is a tiebreaker question, which results in the 'value' and 'order_number' liss being one less entry shorter, so in those cases we append 'Tiebreaker' to each list. We then create a base dataframe, and use a for loops to concatenate all other games on top of the base."

    "In responses.json each line is its own clue and the entries are 'correct_response', 'value', 'order_number', 'correct', 'incorrect' and 'game_id'. While we already have the correct response stored in clues.json, responses.json stores who answered the questions correctly in lists, which is not possible in the clues spider. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by creating the 'show_number' column based on 'game_id', which will help us merge this dataframe with the clues dataframe. We then convert the lists of 'correct' and 'incorrect' into strings, which makes it more readable. We also create columns based on the number of people who answered correctly, incorrectly, or did not know. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to merge these datasets, we must merge on 'show_number', 'correct_response', 'value', and'order_number'. 'show_number' and 'corrrect_response' pose no troubles, but we must modify things for 'value' and 'order_number'. Since the data for correct responses comes from a separate page, the notation is slightly different than for the clues data. The page for correct responses does not include the 'DD: ' to indicate a daily double, so we create a 'value_merge' column in the clues dataframe that replaces the 'DD: ' with ''. Additionally, tiebreakers also cause trouble in merging these two dataframes because in responses.json their 'value' and 'order_number' are NaN. To fix this, we find all tiebreaker questions from the clues dataframe (there's only 7), create masks in order to identify those clues in the responses dataframe, then replace their 'value_merge' and 'order_number' values with \"Tiebreaker\" in order for the dataframes to merge properly."

    "### Reading categories.json\n",
    "\n",
    "categories.json is especially weird, but workable. One intricacy of this data is that there is always a tiebreaker category, even for games that did not end in tiebreakers. This is because we still need the category for tiebreakers, and there was no way to only include that data specifically for tiebreaker games. When scraping the data, categories are scraped into a list, and then gets assigned to its correct column by its index location. Since the list can have a length of either 13 or 14, we assign the final jeopardy category to the 13th index and the tiebreaker to the last element of the index. What this means is that for games without tiebreakers, the tiebreaker category will be the same as the final jeopardy category, but for games that end in tiebreakers their tiebreaker category is correctly labelled. Ultimately, there is lots of redundant data, but that data 'disappears' when merging it to the main clues data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each value is a list of length one, we begin by turning each list into a string and remove the '' enclosing it. We then melt the dataframe so that the columns become rows. We break the new 'variable' column that contains the location of each category down into a 'round' and 'column' columns. Finally we make the data uppercase and rename the columns so they can be properly used in a merge. "
